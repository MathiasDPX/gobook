# `gobook init`

The `init` creates a minimal boilerplate for your new books.

The minimal files are these:

```
book/
├── _site.yml
└── pages/
    ├── INDEX.md
    └── SUMMARY.md
```

- The `_site.yml` file is where you write your config in YAML. Including name and more
- The `pages` directory is where you store your pages to be rendered
